  If you are interested in working on this Swift project in Apple's Xcode along with me, please send me a message here or on LinkedIn. I am not going to publically make the code available unless someone asks for it who can review Swift and SwiftUI. 
  The project was designed with Swift libraries for iOS 12.0 as the minimum required version running on iPhone 6S Plus or later. Preferreably iPhone XS Max or later, as most all of the assets support the Notch'd iPhones. Asset files have been created, GameScene.swift and GameScene.sks have the most work completed, (the main branch for the rest of the projects code) See sample tab for GameScene.swift excerpt of main code.
